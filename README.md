<h2>Speed Racers</h2>

<p>Browser game, synthesizing all the knowledge you've packed into your brain over the past week! You'll be leveraging the power of JavaScript to create a Racing Game, where two players can move their "cars" across the browser to compete for the win.</p>

<h3>Skills Utilized:</h3

<ul>
	<li>Terminal</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Use <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>. Keep an eye out for the <code>$</code> symbol when looking for solutions! example: <code>$('div')</code>. That's jQuery, we'll get there later.</li>
	<li>Minimize the use of global variables</li>
	<li>Abide by the <strong>separation of concerns</strong> principle with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files</li>
	<li>Leverage CSS styling for a pleasing and user experience</li>
	<li>Stick with the <strong>KISS</strong> (Keep It Simple Stupid) and <strong>DRY</strong> (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles</li>
	<li>Use <strong>a public Github repository</strong> with frequent commits and descriptive commit messages!</li>
	<li>See a two "players" on the left side of the screen, one above another.</li>
	<li>See a finish line on the right side of the screen.</li>
	<li>Move each player towards the finish line by pressing a specific key (ex. right arrow for player one, 'd' for player 2).</li>
	<li>Let the players know the race is over when one player has crossed the finish line</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Let the user know if player one or player two won!</li>
	<li>Keep track of <strong>multiple game rounds</strong> with a win counter.</li>
	<li>Make it look amazing!</li>
	<li>Allow <strong>customized players</strong> (name, symbol, color, avatar, etc.).</li>
	<li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> to <strong>keep track of game state</strong>, even if the user refreshes the page.</li>
	<li>Get creative with <strong>inventive styling</strong>, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up. Get creative with backgrounds.</li>
	<li>Display a <strong>countdown timer</strong> ("3, 2, 1, Go!"), the winning time, and the best time.</li>
	<li><strong>Race against a bot</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Instant replay</strong>: record yourself and then race against yourself, in real-time.</li>
	<li>Integrate with a <strong>3rd party API</strong>: flickr, youtube, spotify, giphy, etc.</li>
	<li>Whatever else your heart desires!</li>
</ul>
